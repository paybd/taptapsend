# TapTapSend (Vite + React + PWA)

A minimal React app bootstrapped with Vite and configured as a Progressive Web App using `vite-plugin-pwa`.

## Scripts

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## PWA
- Auto registers the service worker with auto-update.
- Manifest is generated with placeholders.
- Add install icons to `public/`:
  - `public/pwa-192x192.png`
  - `public/pwa-512x512.png`

Recommended: provide maskable PNG icons for best results.
